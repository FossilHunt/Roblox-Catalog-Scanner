# Catalog Scanner

This catalog scanner scans Roblox for old clothing, accessories, and places from the classic era (2008-2015).

## About

I created this scanner because I was curious how many items from old Roblox are still available and not deleted.  

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FossilHunt/Roblox-Catalog-Scanner.git
cd Roblox-Catalog-Scanner
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install ...
```

## Important
Add your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie to the script for better rate limits.
This is absolutly needed if you dont want to get rate limited.  
I first tried using the scanner without Cookie and i got rate limited to 1 scan every 20 seconds.  
If you add your cookie you are able so scan 1.9/s, so thats much faster.

I know its possible to use proxies instead of your cookies but adding your cookie is free and much easier.

Run the scanner:
```bash
python roblox_scanner_cleaned.py
```

## Improvements

I will keep updating this repo and add my suggestions.
